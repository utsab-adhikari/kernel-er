# Philosophy

kernel-er exists because modern software education often prioritizes tools,
frameworks, and results over understanding.

This project intentionally moves in the opposite direction.


## Learning as Construction, Not Consumption

Understanding is built, not absorbed.

Reading documentation, kernel source code, and system behavior
is more important than following step-by-step instructions.

The goal is not to finish tasks, but to refine mental models.


## Systems Thinking Over Abstractions

High-level abstractions hide cost, behavior, and trade-offs.

kernel-er focuses on:
- how processes are created
- how memory is managed
- how the kernel mediates access to hardware

Only by understanding these foundations can higher-level systems be trusted.


## Identity Through Depth

kernel-er is not a side project.
It is a reflection of how I think, learn, and grow as an engineer.

The value of this project increases with time, patience, and honesty.


## Responsibility to the Future Self

Everything written here is meant to be read again years later.

If something cannot be defended with clarity,
it does not belong in the permanent record.

kernel-er is a promise to never confuse activity with understanding.
