# kernel-er

**kernel-er** is a lifelong systems engineering project focused on deeply understanding
Linux, operating system internals, and low-level computing — not by copying tutorials,
but by reasoning, experimenting, and documenting every step honestly.

This project is not a Linux distribution, not a framework, and not a shortcut.
It is a personal OS laboratory and a public record of how my understanding evolves over time.

## What kernel-er is

- A C-first exploration of operating system concepts
- A disciplined, slow-moving, understanding-driven project
- A long-term record of learning, mistakes, and clarity
- A separation of **experiments** and **truth**
- A project that values depth over speed


## What kernel-er is NOT

- Not a copy-paste Linux-from-scratch guide
- Not a production Linux distribution
- Not a place for rushed commits or shallow explanations
- Not driven by trends, hype, or timelines


## Project Structure

- `main` branch represents **fully understood, reviewed work**
- Secondary branches are used for **experiments, noise, and confusion**
- Only validated understanding reaches `main`

## Guiding Principle

> If I cannot explain it clearly in my own words,  
> I do not understand it — and it does not belong here.
